                                    <p>
                                        Site is underdone because a creator lost desire to keep on working on it. I have done necessary markup and have added styles. All i needed was to add content in order to make my website look fulfilled and do not give the impression of an empty sheet. That process would take too much time which I could spend on learning something new. So that’s what i did.  
                                    </p>

                                    <h3>The Idea</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        It was September 2019 when I actually had been starting learning web-programming. Idea of creating site, as you can see above, came to my mind when I was at my English class. That day we had to learn a new topic and while I was taking notes, the idea of making internet project to learn English for free for everybody came to my mind. At that time I already knew how it would look on the site. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Technical part</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        That project was written by me using basic skills of HTML5 and CSS3. It took about month to learn them. At that time I didn't even know how to hide element and show it when it’s required, thus I had to seek out a solution. Evidently, that  was simple JavaScript that scared me.
                                    </p>
